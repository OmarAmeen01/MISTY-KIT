## New Plans from ASS
**16/12/2024 - Aaryan's Thoughts:**
- **Night-time Study Focus**: People study at night, and we won't just focus on JEE and NEET.
    - The best part is we will organize a whole India JEE pre-JEE exam where everyone can come and give JEE at a specific time for 3 hours. People will be asked to give it genuinely; if someone cheats, they are only deceiving themselves.
    - This will be the **BEST PR stunt**: 20L students will give JEE on our platform, and rankings will show where they stand before the actual JEE exam.
    - **Upselling the Service**: We can upsell our service at **1599 a month** or something similar. We will get the most sales when JEE or NEET approaches.
- **Mock Exams and All India Rank**: Other platforms do mock exams, but how do I know my all-India rank (approx.)? We will partner with all the coaching institutes, doing a revenue share with them, ensuring profits. The goal is to acquire as many customers as possible.
    - After that, we will shift business focus to **data and AI models** for government exams and similar purposes, like UPI became the backbone for payments everywhere. We will be the **backbone** for exams and academic infrastructure across the country.
Unlike existing platforms that are fragmented, we aim to be the UNIFIED EDUCATIONAL ECOSYSTEM.
